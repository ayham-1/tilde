				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>this is how i run my desktop. it is the only way any personal
				desktop should work based on my rationale. if you would like to
				recommend or comment on my setup contact me <a href="contact.htm">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Software</h3>
				<p>i like to keep it <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a>,
				ofc only when it makes sense to do so. the only
				systemd-less distro that is usable is
				<a href="https://artixlinux.org">artix linux</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>dwm</li>
					<li>dmenu</li>
					<li>surf</li>
					<li>slock</li>
					<li>slstatus</li>
				</ul>
				<p>...and for non-suckless stuff:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>alacritty</li>
					<li>firefox</li>
					<li>brave</li>
					<li>baku</li>
					<li>newsboat</li>
					<li>mpd & ncmpcpp</li>
					<li>bpytop</li>
					<li>neovim</li>
					<li>pywal</li>
					<li>sxiv</li>
					<li>zathura</li>
					<li>thunar</li>
				</ul>
				<p>lastly, security (includes non-software):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>firejail</li>
					<li>apparmor</li>
					<li>hardened-linux kernel</li>
					<li>luks2 encrypted main partition (root,
						swap, data on lvm over luks)</li>
					<li>luks1 encrypted /boot parition</li>
				</ul>
				<p>there are scripts i use for choosing
				startup application on login and
				organizing them into their workspaces.
				and scripts for searching the web,
				bookmarks, from the comfort of dwm &
				dmenu. those scripts can be found
				<a href="https://tildegit.org/ayham/dotfiles/src/branch/master/.local/bin">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Rationale, i.e. ramble</h3>
				<p>suckless software, this suite of
				software almost always does the right job,
				with a very simple and readable C codebase.
				dwm does a great job as it tiles windows and
				interferes just enough so that you can still
				have a dynamic workflow that is has no
				alt-tab nonsense. dmenu is used in alot of
				my helper scripts, it is minimal and patchable
				to do fuzzy search. surf is used as a dummy
				browser in the sense that it is there for
				when i need to use it and firefox & brave
				fails. the only reason i don't use surf as
				much as firefox is due to it's lack of
				built-in security (this is _kinda_ fixed
				with the use of apparmor & firejail). slock
				just locks your screen, shouldn't have
				nonsense profile pictures and gui. slstatus
				is very easily patachable and does it's job
				out-of-the box. the reason alacritty is used
				over st, is that it just works with the same
				minimalism that st offers (without that
				small codebase ofc). baku for bookmarks.
				newsboat is the only way to consoom media.
				mpd & ncmpcpp, a bit bloat but does the job
				well. bpytop has disk and network IO in the
				same window. pywal, because having an
				inconsistent colorscheme is disgusting.
				sxiv, minimal, doesn't miss with the zoom
				and has sane keybindings compared to feh.
				zathura, the perfect PDF viewer, it
				literally views a PDF, and prints it, what
				else should a PDF viewer do? edit pdfs?
				thunar, decent keybindings and is minimal
				enough to do quick file moves. i primary use
				it as a backup for plain-old mv, cp & rm
				commands. for security, apparmor is way
				easier than selinux. firejail sits on top of
				apparmor. hardened-linux kernel, must have,
				the kernel shouldn't have any comprimises in
				security. encrypted disk is essential,
				literally has no cost but entering a
				password on boot. the alternative is to
				allow anyone who has physical access data
				access.</p>
