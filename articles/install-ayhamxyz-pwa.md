My site is Now Installable as a Web App!

Recently, I have updated my site to offer a Web App option for viewing. You can
install PWA Web Apps on chromium-based browsers, by first accessing
[ayham.xyz](https://ayham.xyz) and then click on the install prompt button on the far-right
edge of the URL bar.

Enjoy!
